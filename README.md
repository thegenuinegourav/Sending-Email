# Sending-Email  
Android App to send Email from an Android application programmatically.  
The demo video of the app is available on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7knHLK3m_g4).  
This app simply takes inputs from user ( like To, Subject, Message) and will send it by invoking any of the existing email client, which is already installed in your device.  
If it is helpful to you then follow me (you can give it a star too), I will make some more useful standard codes.. Happy Coding :)
